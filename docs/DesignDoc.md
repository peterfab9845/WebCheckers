# Application Domain

This section describes the application domain.

![The WebCheckers Domain Model](domain-model-placeholder.png)
> Replace the placeholder image above with your team's own domain model. 

> Provide a high-level overview of the domain for this application. You can discuss the more important domain entities and their relationship to each other.



# Architecture

This section describes the application architecture.

## Summary

The following Tiers/Layers model shows a high-level view of the webapp's architecture.

![The Tiers & Layers of the Architecture](architecture-tiers-and-layers.png)

As a web application, the user interacts with the system using a browser.  The client-side
of the UI is composed of HTML pages with some minimal CSS for styling the page.  There is also
some JavaScript that has been provided to the team by the architect.

The server-side tiers include the UI Tier that is composed of UI Controllers and Views.
Controllers are built using the Spark framework and View are built using the FreeMarker framework.  The Application and Model tiers are built using plain-old Java objects (POJOs).

Details of the components within these tiers are supplied below


## Overview of User Interface

This section describes the web interface flow; this is how the user views and interacts
with the WebCheckers application.

![The WebCheckers Web Interface Statechart](web-interface-placeholder.png)

> Provide a summary of the application's user interface.  Describe, from the user's perspective, the flow of the pages in the web application.


## UI Tier
> Provide a summary of the Server-side UI tier of your architecture.

> Describe the types of components in the tier and describe their responsibilities.

### Static models
> Provide one or more static models (UML class or object diagrams) with some details such as critical attributes and methods.

### Dynamic models
> Provide any dynamic models, such as state and sequence diagrams, as is relevant to a particularly significant user story.

> For example, in WebCheckers you might create a sequence diagram of the `POST /validateMove` HTTP request processing or you might use a state diagram if the Game component uses a state machine to manage the game.
