# Executive Summary

> WebChecker is a platform designed for players to link up and play checkers online. Players get to choose to either to play against an Artificial Intelligence or to choose from a list of active players that are not in a game. After choosing the type of game to play, the user is brought to a screen with the board shown on it, and their opponent also is brought to the same game but from the opposite perspective. From there, they will continue to play the game while being held to the rules of the game. Lastly, players will be able to save and re-watch games they have played in the past.

## Purpose

> Web checkers is a platform for users to come and play checkers online with either their friends or an artificial intelligence.
>
> Our user group includes:
>
> > Parents and childern, who want to add more fun to game night. 
> >
> > Groups of Friends, who are looking for something fun to play.

# Application Domain

This section describes the application domain.

![The WebCheckers Domain Model](domain-model.png)

Web Checkers is based primarily upon individual games of checkers, each having a board and two players. The board contains 64 spaces of alternating colors; each player's pieces can be placed on the dark squares of the board. Each player has 12 pieces; one player has red pieces, and one player has white pieces. When moving pieces, the players are restricted by the rules of Checkers, which dictate where they are allowed to move and what actions they can take. When a game is complete, either player can decide to save the game to their savegame list to rewatch it at a later date.


# Architecture

This section describes the application architecture.

## Summary

The following Tiers/Layers model shows a high-level view of the webapp's architecture.

![The Tiers & Layers of the Architecture](architecture-tiers-and-layers.png)

As a web application, the user interacts with the system using a browser.  The client-side
of the UI is composed of HTML pages with some minimal CSS for styling the page.  There is also
some JavaScript that has been provided to the team by the architect.

The server-side tiers include the UI Tier that is composed of UI Controllers and Views.
Controllers are built using the Spark framework and View are built using the FreeMarker framework.  The Application and Model tiers are built using plain-old Java objects (POJOs).

Details of the components within these tiers are supplied below


## Overview of User Interface

This section describes the web interface flow; this is how the user views and interacts
with the WebCheckers application.

![The WebCheckers Web Interface Statechart](web-interface.png)

When the user first logs in, they are directed to the home page, which will show them the total number of online players, as well as a link to the sign in page. When they click the link to sign in, they see a text box where they can enter a username. If the username is taken or invalid, they will see a message and be directed back to the sign in page. If they enter a valid, unused username, they will be sent back to the home page with a link to sign out and a full list of players' usernames. When they click on another user, if they are not in a game already, the two players will be placed in a game together and sent to the Game page. Until the game is over, it alternates between being the red and white player's turn.


## UI Tier
> Provide a summary of the Server-side UI tier of your architecture.

> Describe the types of components in the tier and describe their responsibilities.

### Static models
> Provide one or more static models (UML class or object diagrams) with some details such as critical attributes and methods.

### Dynamic models
> Provide any dynamic models, such as state and sequence diagrams, as is relevant to a particularly significant user story.

> For example, in WebCheckers you might create a sequence diagram of the `POST /validateMove` HTTP request processing or you might use a state diagram if the Game component uses a state machine to manage the game.
